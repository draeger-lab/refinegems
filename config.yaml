Description: > 
  This file can be adapted to choose what refinegems should do.
  Note: For windows use \ instead of / for the paths


General Setting: >
  Path to GEM to be investigated

model: 'data/e_coli_core.xml' #'../C_striatum_GEMs/models/Cstr_14.xml'


Settings for scripts that manipulate the model: >
  They are all split into the ON / OFF switch (TRUE / FALSE) and additional settings like a path to where the new model should be saved.

### Addition of KEGG Pathways as Groups ###
keggpathways: FALSE
kegg_path: '../Nextcloud/master_thesis/models/Cstr_17_kegg.xml' # path where to save model with KEGG Groups

### SBO-Term Annotation (requires PostgreSQL) ###
sboterms: FALSE
database_user: postgres
database_name: sbo_ann
sbo_path: '../Nextcloud/master_thesis/models/Cstr_17_sbo.xml' # path where to save model with sbo terms

### CarveMe polishing ###
polish_carveme: FALSE
polish_path: '../Nextcloud/master_thesis/models/Cstr_17_genes.xml' # path where to save the polished model
entrez_email: 'famke.baeuerle@student.uni-tuebingen.de'

### Charge correction ###
charge_corr: FALSE
charge_path: '../Nextcloud/master_thesis/models/Cstr_16_charges.xml'


Settings for scripts that investigate the model: >
  These are only necessary if none of the scripts to manipulate the model are used.

memote: FALSE

# Determine if output file should be created, default: cl
# Filename is set as the models name
output: xlsx #cl, xlsx, csv
