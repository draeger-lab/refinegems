model: '../Nextcloud/master_thesis/models/Cstr_16_charges.xml' #GCF_002156805.1_ASM215680v1_protein.xml' #'models/cstr_ma.xml' #'models/CStr_20210518.xml' 


Settings for scripts that manipulate the model: >
  They are all split into the ON / OFF switch (TRUE / FALSE) and additional settings like a path to where the new model should be saved.
