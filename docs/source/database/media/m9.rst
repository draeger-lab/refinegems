M9 minimal medium (M9)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The M9 minimal medium (M9) *in silico* definition consists of all compounds described by `Sigma-Aldrich 
<https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/DE/de/product/sigma/m6030>`__. M9 is a minimal medium commonly used in microbiology and 
was developed in 1988\ :footcite:p:`becardEarlyEventsVesicular1988`. Since then, M9 has been adapted with different 
kinds of additives and used to gather insight into carbon or nitrogen sources\ 
:footcite:p:`hawkeyCuratedCollectionKlebsiella2022`. The medium definition used in this study is based on the provider 
reference\ :footcite:p:`M9Minimalsalze5XPowder` and was further supplemented with MgSO\ :sub:`4`\ \* 7H\ :sub:`2`\ O, 
CaCl\ :sub:`2`\ \* 2H\ :sub:`2`\ O and Glucose\ :footcite:p:`Baeuerle2023_M9_repo,Baeuerle2023_M9`.
