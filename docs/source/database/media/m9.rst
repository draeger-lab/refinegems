M9 minimal medium (M9)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The M9 minimal medium (M9) *in silico* definition consists of all compounds described by `Sigma-Aldrich <https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/DE/de/product/sigma/m6030>`__.
M9 is a minimal medium commonly used in microbiology and was developed in 1988\ :footcite:p:`becardEarlyEventsVesicular1988`. 
Since then, M9 has been adapted with different kinds of additives and used to gather insight into carbon or nitrogen sources\ :footcite:p:`hawkeyCuratedCollectionKlebsiella2022`. 
The medium definition used in this study is based on the provider reference\ :footcite:p:`M9Minimalsalze5XPowder` and was further supplemented with MgSO\ :sub:`4`\ \* 7H\ :sub:`2`\ O, CaCl\ :sub:`2`\ \* 2H\ :sub:`2`\ O and Glucose.
