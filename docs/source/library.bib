 abstract = {Isolated lamb oligodendrocytes in tissue culture were tested for their ability to express differentiated functions related to the synthesis of myelin. Galactocerebrosides and sulfatides are highly enriched in myelin and are recognized as markers for myelination. Hence, we followed the synthesis of these glycosphingolipids. At selected times, monolayer cultures of cells were double labeled for 60--72 h with [3H]galactose and H235SO4. Glycosphingolipids were separated and identified by thin layer chromatography. During the first week in tissue culture, there was gradual decline in incorporation of both isotopes relative to the values obtained for freshly isolated cells. However, by 3 weeks high levels of H235SO4 incorporation into sulfatide and [3H]galactose into cerebrosides were found. A complex pattern of incorporation ensued after this peak which varied for each particular glycosphingolipid. It is concluded that: (1) cultured oligodendrocytes retain the capacity to synthesize components of myelin; (2) since the isolated cells have already been involved in myelination, these cultures afford a unique model to study remyelination; and (3) these cells provide a good system to study the properties of oligodendrocytes.}

 abstract = {Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) play key roles in the manifestation of infectious diseases as attachment sites for pathogens. The thin-layer chromatography (TLC) overlay assay represents one of the most powerful approaches for the detection of GSL receptors of microorganisms. Here we report on the direct structural characterization of microbial GSL receptors by employment of the TLC overlay assay combined with infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry (IR-MALDI-o-TOF-MS). The procedure includes TLC separation of GSL mixtures, overlay of the chromatogram with GSL-specific bacteria, detection of bound microbes with primary antibodies against bacterial surface proteins and appropriate alkaline phosphatase labeled secondary antibodies, and in situ MS analysis of bacteria-specific GSL receptors. The combined method works on microgram scale of GSL mixtures and is advantageous in that it omits laborious and time-consuming GSL extraction from the silica gel layer. This technique was successfully applied to the compositional analysis of globo-series neutral GSLs recognized by P-fimbriated Escherichia coli bacteria, which were used as model microorganisms for infection of the human urinary tract. Thus, direct TLC/IR-MALDI-o-TOF-MS adds a novel facet to this fast and sensitive method offering a wide range of applications for the investigation of carbohydrate-specific pathogens involved in human infectious diseases.},

 abstract = {The global emergence of clinical diseases caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is an issue of great concern. EHEC release Shiga toxins (Stxs) as their key virulence factors, and investigations on the cell-damaging mechanisms toward target cells are inevitable for the development of novel mitigation strategies. Stx-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal injury, is the most severe outcome of an EHEC infection. Hemolytic anemia during HUS is defined as the loss of erythrocytes by mechanical disruption when passing through narrowed microvessels. The formation of thrombi in the microvasculature is considered an indirect effect of Stx-mediated injury mainly of the renal microvascular endothelial cells, resulting in obstructions of vessels. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent data providing evidence that HUS-associated hemolytic anemia may arise not only from intravascular rupture of erythrocytes, but also from the extravascular impairment of erythropoiesis, the development of red blood cells in the bone marrow, via direct Stx-mediated damage of maturing erythrocytes, leading to {\&}ldquo;non-hemolytic{\&}rdquo; anemia.},

During bioreactor cultivations a bi-phasic growth behavior with changing growth rates was observed. Initially the culture grew with before the growth rate dropped to . We were able to confirm the elevated growth rate for C. glutamicum in CGXII and showed for the first time a growth rate beyond 0.6 in lab-scale bioreactor cultivations on defined medium. Advanced growth studies combining well-designed bioreactor and microfluidic single-cell cultivations (MSCC) with quantitative transcriptomics, metabolomics and integrative in silico analysis revealed protocatechuic acid as a hidden co-substrate for accelerated growth within CGXII. The presented approach proves the general applicability of MSCC to investigate and validate the effect of single medium components on microorganism growth during cultivation in liquid media, and therefore might be of interest for any kind of basic growth study.
