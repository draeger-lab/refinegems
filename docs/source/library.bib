 abstract = {Isolated lamb oligodendrocytes in tissue culture were tested for their ability to express differentiated functions related to the synthesis of myelin. Galactocerebrosides and sulfatides are highly enriched in myelin and are recognized as markers for myelination. Hence, we followed the synthesis of these glycosphingolipids. At selected times, monolayer cultures of cells were double labeled for 60--72 h with [3H]galactose and H235SO4. Glycosphingolipids were separated and identified by thin layer chromatography. During the first week in tissue culture, there was gradual decline in incorporation of both isotopes relative to the values obtained for freshly isolated cells. However, by 3 weeks high levels of H235SO4 incorporation into sulfatide and [3H]galactose into cerebrosides were found. A complex pattern of incorporation ensued after this peak which varied for each particular glycosphingolipid. It is concluded that: (1) cultured oligodendrocytes retain the capacity to synthesize components of myelin; (2) since the isolated cells have already been involved in myelination, these cultures afford a unique model to study remyelination; and (3) these cells provide a good system to study the properties of oligodendrocytes.}

 abstract = {Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) play key roles in the manifestation of infectious diseases as attachment sites for pathogens. The thin-layer chromatography (TLC) overlay assay represents one of the most powerful approaches for the detection of GSL receptors of microorganisms. Here we report on the direct structural characterization of microbial GSL receptors by employment of the TLC overlay assay combined with infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry (IR-MALDI-o-TOF-MS). The procedure includes TLC separation of GSL mixtures, overlay of the chromatogram with GSL-specific bacteria, detection of bound microbes with primary antibodies against bacterial surface proteins and appropriate alkaline phosphatase labeled secondary antibodies, and in situ MS analysis of bacteria-specific GSL receptors. The combined method works on microgram scale of GSL mixtures and is advantageous in that it omits laborious and time-consuming GSL extraction from the silica gel layer. This technique was successfully applied to the compositional analysis of globo-series neutral GSLs recognized by P-fimbriated Escherichia coli bacteria, which were used as model microorganisms for infection of the human urinary tract. Thus, direct TLC/IR-MALDI-o-TOF-MS adds a novel facet to this fast and sensitive method offering a wide range of applications for the investigation of carbohydrate-specific pathogens involved in human infectious diseases.},

 abstract = {The global emergence of clinical diseases caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is an issue of great concern. EHEC release Shiga toxins (Stxs) as their key virulence factors, and investigations on the cell-damaging mechanisms toward target cells are inevitable for the development of novel mitigation strategies. Stx-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal injury, is the most severe outcome of an EHEC infection. Hemolytic anemia during HUS is defined as the loss of erythrocytes by mechanical disruption when passing through narrowed microvessels. The formation of thrombi in the microvasculature is considered an indirect effect of Stx-mediated injury mainly of the renal microvascular endothelial cells, resulting in obstructions of vessels. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent data providing evidence that HUS-associated hemolytic anemia may arise not only from intravascular rupture of erythrocytes, but also from the extravascular impairment of erythropoiesis, the development of red blood cells in the bone marrow, via direct Stx-mediated damage of maturing erythrocytes, leading to {\&}ldquo;non-hemolytic{\&}rdquo; anemia.},

Because of increasing rates of multi-drug resistance within the KpSC, there is a growing interest in better understanding the biology and metabolism of these organisms to inform novel control strategies. We collated 37 sequenced KpSC isolates isolated from a variety of niches, representing all seven taxa. We generated strain-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for all 37 isolates and simulated growth phenotypes on 511 distinct carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus substrates. Models were curated and their accuracy was assessed using matched phenotypic growth data for 94 substrates (median accuracy of 96\%). We explored species-specific growth capabilities and examined the impact of all possible single gene deletions using growth simulations in 145 core carbon substrates. These analyses revealed multiple strain-specific differences, within and between species, and highlight the importance of selecting a diverse range of strains when exploring KpSC metabolism. This diverse set of highly accurate GEMs could be used to inform novel drug design, enhance genomic analyses, and identify novel virulence and resistance determinants. We envisage that these 37 curated strain-specific GEMs, covering all seven taxa of the KpSC, provide a valuable resource to the Klebsiella research community.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are organism-specific knowledge bases which can be used to unravel pathogenicity or improve production of specific metabolites in biotechnology applications. However, the validity of predictions for bacterial proliferation in in vitro settings is hardly investigated. Methods: The present work combines in silico and in vitro approaches to create and curate strain-specific genome-scale metabolic models of Corynebacterium striatum. Results: We introduce five newly created strain-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) of high quality, satisfying all contemporary standards and requirements. All these models have been benchmarked using the community standard test suite Metabolic Model Testing (MEMOTE) and were validated by laboratory experiments. For the curation of those models, the software infrastructure refineGEMs was developed to work on these models in parallel and to comply with the quality standards for GEMs. The model predictions were confirmed by experimental data and a new comparison metric based on the doubling time was developed to quantify bacterial growth. Discussion: Future modeling projects can rely on the proposed software, which is independent of specific environmental conditions. The validation approach based on the growth rate calculation is now accessible and closely aligned with biological questions. The curated models are freely available via BioModels and a GitHub repository and can be used. The open-source software refineGEMs is available from \url{https://github.com/draeger-lab/refinegems}.},

We were able to confirm the elevated growth rate for C. glutamicum in CGXII and showed for the first time a growth rate beyond 0.6 in lab-scale bioreactor cultivations on defined medium. Advanced growth studies combining well-designed bioreactor and microfluidic single-cell cultivations (MSCC) with quantitative transcriptomics, metabolomics and integrative in silico analysis revealed protocatechuic acid as a hidden co-substrate for accelerated growth within CGXII. The presented approach proves the general applicability of MSCC to investigate and validate the effect of single medium components on microorganism growth during cultivation in liquid media, and therefore might be of interest for any kind of basic growth study.

abstract = {In this report, a genome-scale reconstruction of Bacillus subtilis metabolism and its iterative development based on the combination of genomic, biochemical, and physiological information and high-throughput phenotyping experiments is presented. The initial reconstruction was converted into an in silico model and expanded in a four-step iterative fashion. First, network gap analysis was used to identify 48 missing reactions that are needed for growth but were not found in the genome annotation. Second, the computed growth rates under aerobic conditions were compared with high-throughput phenotypic screen data, and the initial in silico model could predict the outcomes qualitatively in 140 of 271 cases considered. Detailed analysis of the incorrect predictions resulted in the addition of 75 reactions to the initial reconstruction, and 200 of 271 cases were correctly computed. Third, in silico computations of the growth phenotypes of knock-out strains were found to be consistent with experimental observations in 720 of 766 cases evaluated. Fourth, the integrated analysis of the large-scale substrate utilization and gene essentiality data with the genome-scale metabolic model revealed the requirement of 80 specific enzymes (transport, 53; intracellular reactions, 27) that were not in the genome annotation. Subsequent sequence analysis resulted in the identification of genes that could be putatively assigned to 13 intracellular enzymes. The final reconstruction accounted for 844 open reading frames and consisted of 1020 metabolic reactions and 988 metabolites. Hence, the in silico model can be used to obtain experimentally verifiable hypothesis on the metabolic functions of various genes.}
