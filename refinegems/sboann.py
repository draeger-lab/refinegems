"""Provides functions to automate the addition of SBO terms to the model

Script written by Elisabeth Fritze in her bachelor thesis.
Modified by Gwendolyn O. Gusak during her master thesis.
Commented by Famke BÃ¤uerle and extended by Nantia Leonidou.

It is splitted into a lot of small functions which are all annotated, however when using it for SBO-Term annotation it only makes sense to run the "main" function: sbo_annotation(model_libsbml, database_user, database_name) if you want to continue with the model. The smaller functions might be useful if special information is needed for a reaction without the context of a bigger model or when the automated annotation fails for some reason.
