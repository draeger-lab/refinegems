    Expect the model to contain at least one biomass reaction.

    The biomass composition aka biomass formulation aka biomass reaction
    is a common pseudo-reaction accounting for biomass synthesis in
    constraints-based modelling. It describes the stoichiometry of
    intracellular compounds that are required for cell growth. While this
    reaction may not be relevant to modeling the metabolism of higher
    organisms, it is essential for single-cell modeling.

    Implementation:
    Identifies possible biomass reactions using two principal steps:
    
        1. Return reactions that include the SBO annotation "SBO:0000629" for
        biomass.
        
        2. If no reactions can be identified this way:
        
            1. Look for the ``buzzwords`` "biomass", "growth" and "bof" in reaction IDs.
            2. Look for metabolite IDs or names that contain the ``buzzword`` "biomass" and obtain the set of reactions they are involved in.
            3. Remove boundary reactions from this set.
            4. Return the union of reactions that match the buzzwords and of the reactions that metabolites are involved in that match the buzzword.
        
    This test checks if at least one biomass reaction is present.
    
    If no reaction can be identified return None.

    Expect biomass components to sum up to 1 g[CDW].

    This test only yields sensible results if all biomass precursor
    metabolites have chemical formulas assigned to them.
    The molecular weight of the biomass reaction in metabolic models is
    defined to be equal to 1 g/mmol. Conforming to this is essential in order
    to be able to reliably calculate growth yields, to cross-compare models,
    and to obtain valid predictions when simulating microbial consortia. A
    deviation from 1 - 1E-03 to 1 + 1E-06 is accepted.

    Implementation:
    Multiplies the coefficient of each metabolite of the biomass reaction with
    its molecular weight calculated from the formula, then divides the overall
    sum of all the products by 1000.
